# Post Install
**Congratulations!** You've got your device to boot with the loader application appearing on your homescreen!

## What do I do now?
You can open the loader app and install the package manager you desire.

> If you don't know which one to pick, you can choose **Sileo**, but you may experiment with the other if you feel that Sileo isn't for you.

### Sileo
The modern jailbreak package manager, most commonly used in jailbreaks for the modern-era respecting apple-device philosophies.

### Zebra
Meant to be a more modern, similar feel to the outdated package manager Cydia! 

## Post-bootstrap install
You've made it through the whole entire jailbreaking process! You can now customize your device to your hearts desire, have fun!
